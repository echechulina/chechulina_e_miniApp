# MINI App
Mini Cooper is the standard of taste and value of tradition. Here I use MINI for practice Vue, AJAX and SASS.

# Road Map
Road Map is inside of assets folder.

# Description
Use everything weâ€™ve covered so far - SASS, Vue, AJAX, databases and Fetch to create a dynamic one-page app based on our class build. Click on one of the Mini models to show more content / data about that model. You will be navigating around in your app using Vue lifecycle hooks, components, and AJAX where appropriate.
